## OVRCameraRigInteraction

If you have the CoreSDK/InteractionSDK Assets installed, delete the Default Camera in your scene and just add this prefab into your scene. This Camera works both with Controllers and Handtracking by default.



## Usage
The (hand) interactions made possible with this setup include:

* Grabs (Special Grabs include i.e. Pinch and Pointer)
* Distance Grabs
* Ray Grabs
* Locomotion
* Teleportation

## How to Add Interactions
To add interactions to your OVRCameraRig, all that is required is to modify the state of the object you want to make interactable.

For each type of grab interaction, follow these steps:

Highlight your GameObject, right-click, search for INTERACTION SDK, and choose the type of grab interaction you want to apply to your GameObject.
If your object doesn’t have a Collider or Rigidbody yet, a window will pop up prompting you to click "Create." This will add a child GameObject named "ISDK_...", allowing the object to be interacted with. (This only works because the OVRCameraRigInteraction already has all of the necessary interactors.)
It is recommended NOT to attach every type of interactor to a single GameObject. If you have a large object but only want a small part of it to be interactable, the same rule applies.

There are multiple types of interactions that you can add to a GameObject:
* Hand Grab
* Distance Grab
* Poke
* Ray Grab
* etc.

## Custom Interactions

To add custom interactions for hand/controllers, you will need to reference the OVRHand class or the appropriate controller class for the controllers you’re using. You can also directly read button inputs using the OVRInput class. For an example of both methods, refer to the MetaPen.cs script, or check the official documentation for [more information](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/unity/unity-inputactions).

## Locomotion

The OVRCameraRigInteractable prefab already comes with the necessary setup to implement teleporting and turning via hand tracking.
To enable teleportation, you will need to copy HotspotVoidFloor and NavMeshHotspotWalkable from the Meta Locomotion sample scene. This will create a large plane that allows for teleportation. If you want to prevent teleportation through objects, you will also need to copy CollidersTeleportBlocker.

It may be necessary to adjust the Y-axis of HotspotVoidFloor to ensure the floor does not block teleportation.

Alternatively, for more complex environments, you can use the "Add Teleport Quick Action" from the Oculus SDK. You can also bake a NavMesh and add a teleport interactable to it. However, this is not recommended.

## Scirpts
### FireworkSpawn.cs
Added the Firework Spawn script that takes Spawn Object, Spawn Point, Height Offset, Upward Force.
It spawns an object with upward force (firework) when interacted with via a RayInteractor (Hand and Controller).


### Metamovement.cs
Component script in OVRCameraRig to make sure that the left Oculus-joystick of the Player ensures forward/backward/left/right movement even if head is turned.

### TeleportOnTrigger.cs
Added logic from previous, changed the way it teleports a player on entry. Updated teleport spots to stop teleportation from occuring in the ground.


### PraktikumScenario01_RoleManager.cs
Changed varaibles to fit new camera setup. Tweaked logic to ensure it handles the player correctly.
