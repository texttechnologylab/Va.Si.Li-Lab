  abstract  = {Simulation-based learning is a method in which learners learn
               to master real-life scenarios and tasks from simulated application
               contexts. It is particularly suitable for the use of VR technologies,
               as these allow immersive experiences of the targeted scenarios.
               VR methods are also relevant for studies on online learning, especially
               in groups, as they provide access to a variety of multimodal learning
               and interaction data. However, VR leads to a trade-off between
               technological conditions of the observability of such data and
               the openness of learner behavior. We present Va.Si.Li-Lab, a VR-L
               ab for Simulation-based Learn ing developed to address this trade-off.
               Va.Si.Li-Lab uses a graph-theoretical model based on hypergraphs
               to represent the data diversity of multimodal learning and interaction.
               We develop this data model in relation to mono- and multimodal,
               intra- and interpersonal data and interleave it with ISO-Space
               to describe distributed multiple documents from the perspective
               of their interactive generation. The paper adds three use cases
               to motivate the broad applicability of Va.Si.Li-Lab and its data
               model.},

  abstract  = {During the last thirty years a variety of hypertext approaches
               and virtual environments -- some virtual hypertext environments
               -- have been developed and discussed. Although the development
               of virtual and augmented reality technologies is rapid and improving,
               and many technologies can be used at affordable conditions, their
               usability for hypertext systems has not yet been explored. At
               the same time, even for virtual three-dimensional virtual and
               augmented environments, there is no generally accepted concept
               that is similar or nearly as elegant as hypertext. This gap will
               have to be filled in the next years and a good concept should
               be developed; in this article we aim to contribute in this direction
               and also introduce a prototype for a possible implementation of
               criteria for virtual hypertext simulations.},
